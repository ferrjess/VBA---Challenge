# VBA---Challenge
VBA - Challenge
I want to comment on how I did not know what to write in the README file until one of the TAs posted what to write in Slack. There where no directions on what to write in this file on the Canvas page. Also, I would not have known to create a README file, but I looked at the rubric for the assignment. It was also not in the directions for the assignment.
The goal of this assignment was to use a loop to gather every unique stack ticker name, calcute their individual yearly change and percent change, and calculate the total volume. Once this was completed, we needed to create a VBA code to list which stock had the greatest yearly increase, greatest yearly percent decrease, and which one had the greatest total volume.
